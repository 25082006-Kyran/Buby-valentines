        <div class="letter">
        <p>I can’t even begin to put into words how happy I am that you said “yes” to being my Valentine. When I asked, I couldn’t help but think about how lucky I am to have you in my life. You’re my best friend, my confidant, and the one who makes my heart smile every single day
            From the moment we met, I knew there was something special about you. Your kindness, your laughter, your beautiful soul—it all pulls me in and fills my heart in a way I never imagined possible. You have this amazing way of making everything better, and just being around you makes everything feel so right.
            Every moment I spend with you is a treasure I hold close, and now, with this beautiful gesture, I get to call you my Valentine. I can’t wait to create more memories together, to laugh, to dream, and to love.
            I promise to be there for you, to make you smile, and to cherish you always, not just today, but forever. Thank you for choosing me to be by your side. I’m so excited for all the wonderful moments that await us.</p>
